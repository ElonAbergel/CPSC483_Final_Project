# Transformer-GNN for Logical Precision in CNF to Graph Conversion

## Project Overview

This project focuses on converting Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) logical expressions into graph representations using a Transformer-based Graph Neural Network (GNN). The goal is to enhance logical precision in tasks requiring structured reasoning. The model was benchmarked against ChatGPT's CNF-to-graph conversion performance, showing significant improvements.

## Repository Structure

- **`gnn_logic_.ipynb`**: The main notebook containing the implementation of the Transformer-GNN model and its training pipeline.
- **`main.py`**: The script to evaluate the model's results.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Contains the necessary dependencies to set up the environment.
- **JSON Files**:
  - **`cnf_graph_results_chatgpt.json`**: Baseline CNF-to-graph representations generated by ChatGPT.
  - **`test_cnf_new_model1.json`**, **`test_cnf_new_model2.json`**, **`test_cnf_new_model3.json`**: JSON files containing model predictions for evaluation.

## How to Run

### Step 1: Set Up the Environment

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ElonAbergel/CPSC483_Final_Project.git
   cd CPSC483_Final_Project
   ```

2. install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. run the main function:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
